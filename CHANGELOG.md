# Changelog

Newest first. Each release page on GitHub carries its own section from this file.
Changes made on the server take effect for everyone at once; the ones listed here are those players notice.

## Unreleased

### Fixes
- Draft: the Free entry button sits centred under the screen's text.

## 0.12.19-a - 2026-10-09

Changes since 0.12.3.

### New
- **Match replays.** Matches you play are recorded on the server; Replay in the battle log plays them back, also for other players' matches. The replay moves past the mulligan screen by itself.
- **Friend challenges (direct connect)** work again, between PC and phone too. For now a challenge can only be a Classic or Skirmish match.
- **Friends list** shows who is online or in a match (once you have added each other).
- **Profile:** the Warlord Mastery box is back (your warlord with the most wins).
- **Draft:** the server chooses the packs offered each round. The draft screen has its title, help text and picture again, and the free entry button sits centred.
- **Testers button** in the main menu bar, shown only to in-game testers. Nothing behind it yet.

### Fixes
- Draft: tapping a pack twice quickly could add it to your deck twice, and a pack you had just picked could be offered again straight away.
- A request the mod sends again after a dropped connection is no longer carried out twice by the server.
- The Website button on the Support page opened the site twice.
- After a mod update, the "Mod updated" message now stays on screen for its whole countdown. Its "Close now" button is gone (pressing it froze the game).
- The log now notes screen events (focus lost or regained, no frames drawn for a while) to help track down black or frozen screens.

### Android only
- After a mod update the app now ends at once. Before, on some devices (seen on the MuMu emulator) it could stay half-closed and close itself again on every start until force-stopped.
- **PC emulators** that use Intel's ARM translator (tested on MuMu) can run the mod. This needs the game patched with the patcher in this repository as of this release (`1 - patch.bat`, then install again); phones that already work do not need it.
