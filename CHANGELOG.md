# Changelog

Newest first. Each release page on GitHub carries its own section from this file.
Changes made on the server take effect for everyone at once; the ones listed here are those players notice.

## Unreleased

### New
- **Testers window:** the Testers button opens a window laid out like Collection, with its own ribbon: **Play** (each tester-only mode's own Play-screen tile, placed and sized as on the Play screen, for now Custom Test at full height; picking one opens its page), **Decks** (straight to the Custom Test deck list; Back closes the window) and **Cards** (the card list; for now Space Wolves are left out on purpose, to check it is separate from the normal Collection). While it is open the Testers button is lit in the menu bar, not Collection. The normal Collection > Decks still offers Custom Test.

### Changed
- **Collection > Decks:** Custom Test is no longer offered there; testers build its decks in Testers > Decks. Classic and Skirmish are both full-size tiles again (not yet confirmed).
- **Custom Test** is no longer on the Play screen. It is for testers only and is reached from Testers > Play.
- **Testers button** has its own picture (a servo-tool medallion) instead of Social's helmets.
- **Play screen:** Skirmish and Practice share the first column, one above the other, followed by Classic and then Draft, now called **Classic Draft**.

## 0.12.20-a - 2026-10-09

Changes since 0.12.3 (the first release with a changelog).

### New
- **Match replays.** Matches you play are recorded on the server, and Replay in the battle log plays them back, including other players' matches. The replay moves past the mulligan screen by itself.
- **Friend challenges (direct connect)** work again, between PC and phone too. For now a challenge can only be a Classic or Skirmish match.
- **Friends list** shows who is online or in a match, once you have added each other.
- **Profile:** the Warlord Mastery box is back (your warlord with the most wins).
- **Draft:** the server chooses the packs offered each round. The draft screen has its title, help text and picture again.
- **Testers button** in the main menu bar, shown only to in-game testers. Nothing behind it yet.

### Fixes
- **Draft:** tapping a pack twice quickly should no longer add it to your deck twice, and a pack you just picked should no longer be offered again straight away (not yet confirmed in play).
- **Draft:** the Free entry button is now centred under the screen's text.
- **Retries:** the server no longer carries out a request twice when the mod resends it after a dropped connection.
- **Support:** the Website button no longer opens the site twice.
- **Updates:** the "Mod updated" message now stays on screen for its whole countdown, and the "Close now" button that froze the game is removed.
- **Logging:** the log now notes screen events (focus lost or regained, no frames drawn for a while) to help track down black or frozen screens.

### Android only
- **Updates:** after a mod update the app now closes fully. It no longer gets stuck closing itself on every start until force-stopped (seen on the MuMu emulator).
- **PC emulators:** the mod now runs on emulators that use Intel's ARM translator (tested on MuMu). This needs the game re-patched with this release's patcher (`1 - patch.bat`, then install again). Phones that already work do not need it.
